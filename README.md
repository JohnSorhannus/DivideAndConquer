# Divide And Conquer

Have you ever had a large task on your hands that seemed too daunting to handle? Well, Divide And Conquer is here too help. Divide And Conquer is a productivity app that helps users divide large tasks called "main tasks" into much easier to complete "sub tasks."

Users start by creating a Main Task by hitting '+' in the top bar and hitting 'Add Main Task'

When adding/editing a main task, a user can enter in the name of the main task, assign a color to the task, and set a due date. No sub task's due date can exceed the due date of its main task.

Once a main task has been creating, the user can start to create sub tasks. When adding/editing a sub task, the user can enter in the name of the sub task, select a nonoverdue main task, and select a due date.

Users view their tasks on the main screen. To mark a sub task as complete, users simply hit the checkbox. Users can check the progress they are making on a main task by checking to see the percentage complete for each main task. Additionally, main tasks and sub tasks that are overdue are highlighted in red to warn the user.
